Piano Lesson Program

Policies, Responsibilities, and Expectations

A cooperative learning experience for teachers, parents, and students
Designed to support musical growth, discipline, and success

ELIGIBILITY FOR LESSONS

The following criteria are used to determine the eligibility of the student for lessons:
• the age, maturity and interest of the student
• parental support

The criteria used to determine the eligibility of the student for continuation in the program are the following:
• attendance
• motivation and interest of student
• paid tuition
• preparation of assigned lessons

The teacher reserves the right to terminate lessons with the student if he/she feels that the student would learn better in another situation.

SCHEDULE

Every attempt will be made to schedule lessons at a convenient time for all.

PRACTICE

It is the parents’ responsibility to see that their child practices. There is a direct relationship between regular practice and student success. Parents should establish a regular practice time for their child that is free from distraction, and give positive reinforcement for their child’s practice.

When possible, parents should help their child practice, especially at the beginning levels. If it is not possible to help directly, just being in the room while the child practices is supportive and encouraging.

• First-year students should practice no less than 30 minutes per day.
• Second-and third-year students should practice no less than 45 minutes per day.
• Students in their fourth year and above should practice no less than 60 minutes per day.
• Practicing should occur at least five days per week. If this practice requirement is not followed, it is impossible to guarantee that the student will have a successful or positive learning experience.

PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE LESSON

Students should come to the lessons rested and ready to work.

MUSIC, MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

Each student should have a pencil, as well as a carrying case to transport the music, notebook and other supplies.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

Recitals and other performance opportunities are also an important part of piano lessons. All students will participate in these activities.

PROBLEMS & COMMUNICATION

Parents are encouraged to contact the teacher immediately if they perceive problems with their child’s piano lessons. Waiting too long to talk to the teacher may make the problem unsolvable.

It is impossible for the teacher to speak with parents immediately before or after the child’s lesson since other students have lessons at those times.
