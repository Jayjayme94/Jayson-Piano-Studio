                <p>A cooperative learning experience for teachers, parents, and students.<br>Designed to support musical
                    growth, discipline, and success</p>
            </div>

            <h3>ELIGIBILITY FOR LESSONS</h3>
            <p>The following criteria are used to determine the eligibility of the student for lessons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the age, maturity and interest of the student</li>
                <li>parental support</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The criteria used to determine the eligibility of the student for continuation in the program are the
                following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>attendance</li>
                <li>motivation and interest of student</li>
                <li>paid tuition</li>
                <li>preparation of assigned lessons</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The teacher reserves the right to terminate lessons with the student if he/she feels that the student
                would learn better in another situation.</p>

            <h3>SCHEDULE</h3>
            <p>Every attempt will be made to schedule lessons at a convenient time for all.</p>

            <h3>PRACTICE</h3>
            <p>It is the parents’ responsibility to see that their child practices. There is a direct relationship
                between regular practice and student success. Parents should establish a regular practice time for their
                child that is free from distraction, and give positive reinforcement for their child’s practice.</p>

            <p>When possible, parents should help their child practice, especially at the beginning levels. If it is not
                possible to help directly, just being in the room while the child practices is supportive and
                encouraging.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First-year students should practice no less than 30 minutes per day.</li>
                <li>Second-and third-year students should practice no less than 45 minutes per day.</li>
                <li>Students in their fourth year and above should practice no less than 60 minutes per day.</li>
                <li>Practicing should occur at least five days per week. If this practice requirement is not followed,
                    it is impossible to guarantee that the student will have a successful or positive learning
                    experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE LESSON</h3>
            <p>Students should come to the lessons rested and ready to work.</p>

            <h3>MUSIC, MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES</h3>
            <p>Each student should have a pencil, as well as a carrying case to transport the music, notebook and other
                supplies.</p>

            <h3>OTHER ACTIVITIES</h3>
            <p>Recitals and other performance opportunities are also an important part of piano lessons. All students
                will participate in these activities.</p>

            <h3>COMMUNICATION</h3>
            <p>I value open communication. If you perceive any challenges or have questions about your child’s musical
                journey, please reach out immediately.</p>
